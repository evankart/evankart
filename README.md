# 👋 Hi, I’m Evan Kartheiser
- 👀 I'm a full-stack web developer located in the San Francisco Bay Area.
- ☀️ React, JavaScript, Python.
- ✨ Here's my <a href="http://evankartheiser.com">Personal Website</a>.
- 📫 Or you can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/evankart/">LinkedIn</a>.

I come from a background in Earth Science and have worked in environmental science, outdoor education, and academic publishing before finding my way to web development. I also have extensive experience in data analytics, data visualization, mapping, and web design. 

I aim to direct my technical skills towards creating a positive social impact, and I'm actively looking for a full-stack or frontend developer role at a mission-driven organization alongside a dedicated team.
